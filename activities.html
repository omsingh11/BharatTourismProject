			      	<h1>Ajanta Caves In Maharashtra</h1>
			      	<p>
						One of the first World Heritage sites in India, the Ajanta Caves date back to around 2nd century BCE to 650 CE and consist of the most beautiful masterpieces of 31 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments, paintings and sculpture. The caves very built in two different phases. First of Satavahana Period under the patronage of Satvahana Dynasty (230BCE-220CE). Second, the caves of Vakataka Period under the reign of Emperor Harishena of Vakataka Dynasty. The style of Ajanta art and architecture has had a revolutionary impact on the way in Indian art and architecture has progressed all throughout history. Having mainly carvings and sculptures related to the life of Buddha, one can say that this marks the beginning of Indian Classical Art.
			      	</p>
			      	<p>
						According to UNESCO, these are masterpieces of Buddhist religious art that influenced the Indian art that followed.[6] The caves were built in two phases, the first phase starting around the 2nd century BCE, while the second phase was built around 400–650 CE, according to older accounts, or in a brief period of 460–480 CE according to later scholarship.[7] The site is a protected monument in the care of the Archaeological Survey of India,[8] and since 1983, the Ajanta Caves have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
			      	</p>
			      	<p>
						With the Ellora Caves, Ajanta is one of the major tourist attractions of Maharashtra. It is about 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) from Fardapur, 59 kilometres (37 miles) from the city of Jalgaon, Maharashtra, India, 104 kilometres (65 miles) from the city of Aurangabad, and 350 kilometres (220 miles) east-northeast of Mumbai.[9][20] Ajanta is 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the Ellora Caves, which contain Hindu, Jain and Buddhist caves, the last dating from a period similar to Ajanta. The Ajanta style is also found in the Ellora Caves and other sites such as the Elephanta Caves, Aurangabad Caves, Shivleni Caves and the cave temples of Karnataka.
